# soar-edr-incident-response
SOAR + EDR lab project using LimaCharlie and Tines to detect password recovery tools, send real-time alerts, and automate host isolation.

## üõ°Ô∏è Project Overview
SOAR EDR Incident Response Project demonstrates how to integrate LimaCharlie (EDR) and Tines (SOAR) to automatically detect and respond to credential dumping attempts on a Windows endpoint. It showcases real-time alerts (Slack + Email), analyst decision prompts, and automated host isolation.

## Skills Learned
- Writing custom EDR detection rules (YAML in LimaCharlie).
- Building SOAR workflows in Tines.
- Automating Slack & Email alerts.
- Integrating EDR with SOAR via APIs.
- Host isolation and containment workflows.

## Tools Used
- VMware Workstation
- Windows Server 2016
- LimaCharlie (EDR)
- Tines (SOAR)
- Slack & Email integrations

## üñ•Ô∏è Lab Architecture & Workflow

Shows how suspicious activity on the endpoint is detected, forwarded, and responded to:

1. Endpoint (Windows Server VM) ‚Üí The simulated attacker runs LaZagne, a password recovery tool.
2. LimaCharlie (EDR) ‚Üí Detects the suspicious process execution based on detection rules
3. Tines (SOAR) ‚Üí Receives the alert from LimaCharlie through a webhook integration.
4. Slack & Email ‚Üí Tines automatically notifies the SOC team in real time.
5. Analyst Decision ‚Üí Tines prompts the analyst to decide whether the endpoint should be isolated.
6. Host Isolation ‚Üí If approved, Tines calls the LimaCharlie API to quarantine the endpoint. A confirmation is sent back to Slack.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

- Deployed Windows Server VM and installed LimaCharlie agent.

- Download the appropriate Windows LimaCharlie sensor from the LC console.

- Configured Slack + Email integrations in Tines.
- Built LimaCharlie ‚Üí Tines webhook connection.

## üîç Detection Rules (LimaCharlie)
To detect suspicious credential dumping activity, I created a custom detection rule in LimaCharlie targeting the execution of LaZagne.

### Detection Logic

This rule applies to Windows endpoints and triggers on both `NEW_PROCESS` and `EXISTING_PROCESS` events.
It generates an alert if any of the following conditions are met:
- Process file path ends with `lazagne.exe`
- Command line ends with `all` (a common LaZagne execution flag)
- Command line contains the keyword lazagne
- File hash matches a known LaZagne binary

### Detection Rule (YAML)

```yaml

  events:
    - NEW_PROCESS
    - EXISTING_PROCESS
  op: and
  rules:
    - op: is
    - op: or
      rules:
        - case sensitive: false
          op: ends with
          path: event/FILE_PATH
          value: lazagne.exe
        - case sensitive: false
          op: ends with
          path: event/COMMAND_LINE
          value: all
        - case sensitive: false
          op: contains
          path: event/COMMAND_LINE
          value: lazagne
        - case sensitive: false
          op: is
          path: event/HASH
          value: dc06d62ee95062e714f2566c95b8edaabfd387023b1bf98a09078b84007d5268
```

### Detection Response

The detection is configured to generate a report with context, tagged under MITRE ATT&CK ‚Äì Credential Access.

```yaml

- action: report
  metadata:
    author: MyDFIR
    description: Detects LaZagne (SOAR-EDR Tool)
    falsepositives:
      - A lot
    level: medium
    tags:
      - attack.credential_access
  name: MyDFIR - HackTool - Lazagne (SOAR-EDR)
```

## ‚ö° Tines SOAR Story

![Flow Diagram](screenshots/soar_edr_ir_workflow.png)

This SOAR story in Tines orchestrates the automated incident response workflow. It connects LimaCharlie detections to Slack, Email, and automated host isolation.

### Workflow Steps

**1. Webhook Listener (Retrieve Detections)**
- Tines receives detection alerts from LimaCharlie through a webhook.
- Each detection contains metadata such as time, computer name, source IP, command line, file path, and sensor ID.

**2. Slack & Email Notifications**
- Tines formats the detection details and sends them to Slack and Email in real time.
- This ensures analysts are immediately aware of the suspicious activity.

**3. User Prompt (Decision Point)**
- Analysts receive a decision form in Tines asking: ‚ÄúDo you want to isolate this machine?‚Äù
- Provides context: host, IP, file path, detection link.

**4a. If Analyst Chooses YES**
- Tines issues an HTTP Request to the LimaCharlie API to isolate the sensor (endpoint).
- Another HTTP request retrieves the isolation status.
- Slack receives a confirmation that the host has been isolated.

**4b. If Analyst Chooses NO**
- Tines posts a message in Slack: ‚ÄúThe computer <hostname> was not isolated, please investigate.‚Äù
- This keeps the event open for manual follow-up.


## üì∏ Demonstration Timeline (Incident Response in Action)

Step-by-step sequence:

### 1. Suspicious Tool Execution (Trigger Event)
- LaZagne executed on endpoint.

### 2. Detection Raised (LimaCharlie ‚Üí Tines)
- Alert generated and forwarded.

### 3. Analyst is provided a detection link to further investigate
![Detection Link](screenshots/4_detection_link.png)
 
### 4. Analyst Prompted
- Analyst receives isolation decision form.

### 5. Isolation Executed
- Endpoint quarantined, confirmation posted.

## Possible Next Steps

- Add detection coverage for other credential theft tools.
- Expand SOAR workflows to include ServiceNow/Jira ticketing.
- Enrich alerts with MITRE ATT&CK mappings and threat intel.

## üìù Report

Example: This lab demonstrated that integrating LimaCharlie with Tines provides effective automated response to credential-dumping activity. Detections flowed seamlessly into SOAR, notifications reached analysts, and automated containment reduced MTTR.
