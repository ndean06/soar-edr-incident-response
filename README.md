# soar-edr-incident-response
SOAR + EDR lab project using LimaCharlie and Tines to detect password recovery tools, send real-time alerts, and automate host isolation.

## üõ°Ô∏è Project Overview
SOAR EDR Incident Response Project demonstrates how to integrate LimaCharlie (EDR) and Tines (SOAR) to automatically detect and respond to credential dumping attempts on a Windows endpoint. It showcases real-time alerts (Slack + Email), analyst decision prompts, and automated host isolation.

## Skills Learned
- Writing custom EDR detection rules (YAML in LimaCharlie).
- Building SOAR workflows in Tines.
- Automating Slack & Email alerts.
- Integrating EDR with SOAR via APIs.
- Host isolation and containment workflows.

## Tools Used
- VMware Workstation
- Windows Server 2016
- LimaCharlie (EDR)
- Tines (SOAR)
- Slack & Email integrations

## üñ•Ô∏è Lab Architecture & Workflow

Shows how suspicious activity on the endpoint is detected, forwarded, and responded to:

1. Endpoint (Windows Server VM) ‚Üí The simulated attacker runs LaZagne, a password recovery tool.
2. LimaCharlie (EDR) ‚Üí Detects the suspicious process execution based on detection rules
3. Tines (SOAR) ‚Üí Receives the alert from LimaCharlie through a webhook integration.
4. Slack & Email ‚Üí Tines automatically notifies the SOC team in real time.
5. Analyst Decision ‚Üí Tines prompts the analyst to decide whether the endpoint should be isolated.
6. Host Isolation ‚Üí If approved, Tines calls the LimaCharlie API to quarantine the endpoint. A confirmation is sent back to Slack.
