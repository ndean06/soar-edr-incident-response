# soar-edr-incident-response
SOAR + EDR lab project using LimaCharlie and Tines to detect password recovery tools, send real-time alerts, and automate host isolation.

## üõ°Ô∏è Project Overview
SOAR EDR Incident Response Project demonstrates how to integrate LimaCharlie (EDR) and Tines (SOAR) to automatically detect and respond to credential dumping attempts on a Windows endpoint. It showcases real-time alerts (Slack + Email), analyst decision prompts, and automated host isolation.

## Skills Learned
- Writing custom EDR detection rules (YAML in LimaCharlie).
- Building SOAR workflows in Tines.
- Automating Slack & Email alerts.
- Integrating EDR with SOAR via APIs.
- Host isolation and containment workflows.

## Tools Used
- VMware Workstation
- Windows Server 2016
- LimaCharlie (EDR)
- Tines (SOAR)
- Slack & Email integrations

## üñ•Ô∏è Lab Architecture & Workflow

Shows how suspicious activity on the endpoint is detected, forwarded, and responded to:

1. Endpoint (Windows Server VM) ‚Üí The simulated attacker runs LaZagne, a password recovery tool.
2. LimaCharlie (EDR) ‚Üí Detects the suspicious process execution based on detection rules
3. Tines (SOAR) ‚Üí Receives the alert from LimaCharlie through a webhook integration.
4. Slack & Email ‚Üí Tines automatically notifies the SOC team in real time.
5. Analyst Decision ‚Üí Tines prompts the analyst to decide whether the endpoint should be isolated.
6. Host Isolation ‚Üí If approved, Tines calls the LimaCharlie API to quarantine the endpoint. A confirmation is sent back to Slack.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

- Deployed Windows Server VM and installed LimaCharlie agent.

- Download the appropriate Windows LimaCharlie sensor from the LC console.

- Configured Slack + Email integrations in Tines.
- Built LimaCharlie ‚Üí Tines webhook connection.

## üîç Detection Rules (LimaCharlie)
To detect suspicious credential dumping activity, I created a custom detection rule in LimaCharlie targeting the execution of LaZagne.

### Detection Logic

This rule applies to Windows endpoints and triggers on both `NEW_PROCESS` and `EXISTING_PROCESS` events.
It generates an alert if any of the following conditions are met:
- Process file path ends with `lazagne.exe`
- Command line ends with `all` (a common LaZagne execution flag)
- Command line contains the keyword lazagne
- File hash matches a known LaZagne binary

### Detection Rule (YAML)

```yaml

  events:
    - NEW_PROCESS
    - EXISTING_PROCESS
  op: and
  rules:
    - op: is
    - op: or
      rules:
        - case sensitive: false
          op: ends with
          path: event/FILE_PATH
          value: lazagne.exe
        - case sensitive: false
          op: ends with
          path: event/COMMAND_LINE
          value: all
        - case sensitive: false
          op: contains
          path: event/COMMAND_LINE
          value: lazagne
        - case sensitive: false
          op: is
          path: event/HASH
          value: dc06d62ee95062e714f2566c95b8edaabfd387023b1bf98a09078b84007d5268

```

### Detection Response

The detection is configured to generate a report with context, tagged under MITRE ATT&CK ‚Äì Credential Access.

```yaml

- action: report
  metadata:
    author: ndean
    description: Detects LaZagne (SOAR-EDR Tool)
    falsepositives:
      - a lot
    level: medium
    tags:
      - attack.credential_access
  name: MyDFIR - HackTool - Lazagne (SOAR-EDR)
```

## üîÆ Next Steps

Add detection coverage for other credential theft tools.

Expand SOAR workflows to include ServiceNow/Jira ticketing.

Enrich alerts with MITRE ATT&CK mappings and threat intel.

## üìù Report

Short narrative summary ‚Äî written like a mini SOC incident report.
Example: This lab demonstrated that integrating LimaCharlie with Tines provides effective automated response to credential-dumping activity. Detections flowed seamlessly into SOAR, notifications reached analysts, and automated containment reduced MTTR.
